Thanks for downloading Sharp Text Mesh.

Visit scene called Demo and hit play. Now you see 3 texts. Blurry text and Text with hard edges have set text propeties from the inspector.

Sharp text's propeties are controlled by a script "Sharptext". The script adjusts the text´s propeties to match Resolution and Ortographic camera size to achieve sharp looking text.

You can set the size of your text in units intead of pixels. This is handy when you are using texts as a part of gameplay.

The script can be atached to any gameobject with Text Mesh component.
